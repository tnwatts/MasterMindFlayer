# <Master Mind Flayer>

Master Mind is a code breaking game invented in the 1970's. It is a favorite among computer scientists because the simplistic nature of the code allows for many different types of aglorithms to be used in cracking the code. Commercially it is marketed mostly toward children. 

The standard words calls for one player or computer to choose 4 uniqiue colored pegs to be chosen from a group of 6, while the other player has 10 turns to try and crack the code. The player receives feedback at the end of each round indicating how many tiles are the correct color in the correct spot and how many are the correct color but not in the correct spot. 

This version of Master Mind includes a second level after the first is beaten. The second level faces the player against the aberation commonly refered to as a Mind Flayer. The Mind Flayer is a monstrous humanoid with psionic/psychic powers, making it the perfect opponent in a game of minds.
